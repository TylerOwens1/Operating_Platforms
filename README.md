  -Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client wants to create a mutypalyer online game that can take clients from any diffrent operating system. They wanted me to design both the server and the client software and how they communcate.

  -What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think I did a good job of considering the constraintes of a multi client server relationship. Especially one where the clients could come from any opperating system.

  -What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I think it was important to think about how the code was going to communicte before developing the code. If this is developed first it alows for testing before the completion of both the client and the server.

  -If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would be more spicific in my recomendations. I would theoreticly talk with the client about budget and expectation of theis program and use that to make spicific sugesstions on what services and what kind of team would be needed to build out this type of program.

  -How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I read all of the documents and tried to extrapolate any needs that were not explicitly stated. You have to consider the users goals and asperations so that you know how to design a program.

  -How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I started with looking up platforms and servesis I know and know how to use and then sperad my search to alternitives. When I had several alternatives I would compare them to my orginal option.
